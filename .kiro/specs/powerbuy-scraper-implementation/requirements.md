# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a production-ready web scraping solution for BKK Gadget Hub to extract competitor pricing data from PowerBuy.co.th. The system must handle dynamic JavaScript-loaded content, process 20 specific product URLs, and deliver clean CSV output for daily competitive intelligence. The solution builds upon a successful POC that demonstrated API interception capabilities and must be architected as a modular, maintainable business intelligence tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to automatically extract product data from 20 specific PowerBuy URLs, so that I can receive accurate competitor pricing information without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes the 20 URLs from `20urls.txt` THEN it SHALL extract Product Name, SKU, Price, and Stock Status for each product
2. WHEN a URL contains search results with multiple products THEN the system SHALL extract data from all products found on that search page
3. WHEN the system encounters pagination THEN it SHALL automatically navigate through all pages to collect complete data
4. IF a URL fails to load or extract data THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing remaining URLs
5. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with all successfully extracted product data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the scraper to handle dynamic JavaScript content reliably, so that I get accurate pricing data that loads after the initial page render.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system accesses PowerBuy pages THEN it SHALL wait for JavaScript content to fully load before extracting data
2. WHEN product prices are loaded via AJAX calls THEN the system SHALL intercept API responses to capture structured JSON data
3. WHEN the system encounters Cloudflare protection THEN it SHALL bypass it using browser automation techniques
4. IF dynamic content fails to load within timeout THEN the system SHALL retry once before marking as failed
5. WHEN API interception is successful THEN the system SHALL prioritize JSON data over HTML parsing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to follow a modular architecture, so that it's maintainable and can be extended for future requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the modular structure defined in `architecture.md`
2. WHEN scraping logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be separated into `scrapers/` module
3. WHEN data parsing is implemented THEN it SHALL be separated into `parsers/` module  
4. WHEN data validation is implemented THEN it SHALL use Pydantic models in `validators/` module
5. WHEN the main orchestration is implemented THEN it SHALL be in `main.py` with clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want robust data validation and error handling, so that I receive clean, reliable data even when some URLs fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product data is extracted THEN it SHALL be validated using Pydantic models with proper type checking
2. WHEN price data is extracted THEN it SHALL be converted to float type and validated as numeric
3. WHEN stock status is extracted THEN it SHALL be normalized to standard values (In Stock/Out of Stock)
4. IF data validation fails for a product THEN the system SHALL log the error and exclude that product from output
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL only include successfully validated products in the CSV output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to generate clean CSV output, so that I can easily import the data into my pricing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with columns: Name, SKU, Price, Stock Status
2. WHEN CSV is generated THEN it SHALL be named with the current date format `competitor_prices_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
3. WHEN multiple products are found per URL THEN each product SHALL be a separate row in the CSV
4. WHEN the CSV is created THEN it SHALL use UTF-8 encoding to handle Thai characters properly
5. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of total products extracted and any failures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to scrape ethically and reliably, so that it doesn't get blocked and respects the target website's resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the server
2. WHEN browser automation is used THEN it SHALL use realistic user agent strings and viewport settings
3. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL maintain persistent browser context to appear as a returning user
4. IF the system detects blocking or rate limiting THEN it SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
5. WHEN scraping is complete THEN the system SHALL properly close browser resources and clean up temporary files
