# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a data processing solution for BKK Gadget Hub to convert manually collected raw product data from PowerBuy.co.th into clean CSV output for competitive intelligence. The system builds upon the successful POC that demonstrated API interception capabilities, but focuses on processing pre-collected raw data rather than full automation. The solution emphasizes data validation, cleaning, and formatting to deliver reliable business intelligence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to process manually collected raw product data, so that I can convert it into clean CSV format for pricing decisions without complex automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw product data is provided in JSON format THEN the system SHALL process it to extract Product Name, SKU, Price, and Stock Status
2. WHEN multiple products are provided in the raw data THEN the system SHALL process each product individually
3. WHEN the raw data contains nested product information THEN the system SHALL flatten it into tabular format
4. IF raw data is malformed or missing fields THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip that product
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with all successfully processed product data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a simple manual data collection method, so that I can gather raw product data when needed without complex automation setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to collect product data THEN I SHALL be able to use the POC scraper to manually search and capture JSON responses
2. WHEN I run the manual collection process THEN it SHALL save raw JSON data to a file for later processing
3. WHEN I collect data from different search terms THEN the system SHALL organize the raw data by search term or category
4. IF I need to collect data from specific product pages THEN the system SHALL provide a simple method to capture individual product data
5. WHEN raw data collection is complete THEN it SHALL be saved in a format that the producer component can process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a producer component that processes raw data efficiently, so that I can convert collected JSON data into business-ready CSV format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the producer component is implemented THEN it SHALL read raw JSON data files from a designated input directory
2. WHEN processing raw data THEN it SHALL extract relevant product fields (name, sku, price, stock) from the JSON structure
3. WHEN data parsing is implemented THEN it SHALL handle the PowerBuy JSON format discovered in the POC
4. WHEN data validation is implemented THEN it SHALL use Pydantic models to ensure data quality
5. WHEN the producer runs THEN it SHALL generate clean CSV output with proper formatting and encoding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want robust data validation and error handling, so that I receive clean, reliable data even when some URLs fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product data is extracted THEN it SHALL be validated using Pydantic models with proper type checking
2. WHEN price data is extracted THEN it SHALL be converted to float type and validated as numeric
3. WHEN stock status is extracted THEN it SHALL be normalized to standard values (In Stock/Out of Stock)
4. IF data validation fails for a product THEN the system SHALL log the error and exclude that product from output
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL only include successfully validated products in the CSV output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to generate clean CSV output, so that I can easily import the data into my pricing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with columns: Name, SKU, Price, Stock Status
2. WHEN CSV is generated THEN it SHALL be named with the current date format `competitor_prices_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
3. WHEN multiple products are found per URL THEN each product SHALL be a separate row in the CSV
4. WHEN the CSV is created THEN it SHALL use UTF-8 encoding to handle Thai characters properly
5. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of total products extracted and any failures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to be simple and reliable for manual operation, so that I can collect data when needed without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to collect data manually THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for using the POC scraper
2. WHEN running manual collection THEN it SHALL use the existing browser automation setup with proper stealth features
3. WHEN collecting data THEN it SHALL save results in an organized way for easy processing later
4. IF manual collection encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and continue where possible
5. WHEN manual collection is complete THEN it SHALL provide a summary of what data was collected and where it was saved
