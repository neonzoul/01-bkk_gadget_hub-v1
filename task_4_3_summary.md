# Task 4.3 Implementation Summary

## Task: Implement data organization and storage

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Requirements Addressed:** 2.5, 6.5

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive data organization and storage enhancements for the PowerBuy scraper system. This task established a robust, organized data storage architecture with enhanced metadata tracking, standardized file naming conventions, and seamless integration with the existing ManualCollector class.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. DataOrganizer Class (`src/collectors/data_organizer.py`)

A comprehensive data organization manager that provides:

- **Organized Directory Structure**: Automatic creation and management of organized directories
- **Session Management**: Complete session lifecycle tracking with metadata
- **File Naming Standards**: Consistent, timestamp-based file naming conventions
- **Metadata Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata for all collection activities

#### Directory Structure Created:
```
raw_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ search_results/          # Search result data organized by date
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD/         # Date-based subdirectories
â”œâ”€â”€ individual_products/     # Individual product data organized by date
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD/         # Date-based subdirectories
â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/               # Session-specific directories
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD/        # Date-based session organization
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata/              # Session metadata files
â””â”€â”€ processed/             # Processed data storage
```

### 2. Enhanced ManualCollector Integration

Updated the ManualCollector class to use the DataOrganizer:

- **Seamless Integration**: DataOrganizer integrated without breaking existing functionality
- **Organized Storage Methods**: New methods for organized data storage
- **Session Context**: All data saved with session context and metadata
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy directory references maintained

#### New Methods Added:
- `save_search_results_organized()`: Save search results with enhanced organization
- `save_individual_product_organized()`: Save individual products with organization
- `get_data_organization_info()`: Get directory structure information
- `list_collection_sessions()`: List all collection sessions
- `get_session_details()`: Get detailed session information

### 3. File Naming Conventions

Implemented standardized file naming with timestamps and search terms:

#### Search Results:
```
{search_term}_{session_id}_{YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS}.json
```
Example: `iPhone_15_20250730_144220_2025-07-30_14-42-46.json`

#### Individual Products:
```
product_{product_id}_{session_id}_{YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS}.json
```
Example: `product_TEST123_20250730_144220_2025-07-30_14-42-46.json`

### 4. Comprehensive Metadata Tracking

Each collection session generates comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "session_id": "20250730_144220",
  "start_time": "2025-07-30T14:42:20.024130",
  "end_time": "2025-07-30T14:42:54.022575",
  "search_terms": ["iPhone 15", "Samsung Galaxy S24"],
  "session_dir": "raw_data\\sessions\\2025-07-30\\20250730_144220",
  "files_created": [...],
  "products_collected": 80,
  "errors": [],
  "status": "completed",
  "duration_seconds": 33.998445,
  "files_count": 2
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Data Files

Each saved data file includes comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "search_term": "iPhone 15",
  "collection_timestamp": "2025-07-30T14:42:46.920093",
  "session_id": "20250730_144220",
  "total_products": 50,
  "file_path": "raw_data\\search_results\\2025-07-30\\iPhone_15_20250730_144220_2025-07-30_14-42-46.json",
  "data": {
    "search_term": "iPhone 15",
    "total_products": 50,
    "api_responses_received": 1,
    "products": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "collection_method": "manual_collector",
    "data_source": "powerbuy.co.th",
    "file_format": "json",
    "encoding": "utf-8"
  }
}
```
